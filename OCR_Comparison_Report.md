- **Low Latency Priority**: Tesseract (66.7%, 0.71s)
- **Balanced**: PaddleOCR offers best compromise

### Deployment Strategy

- **On-premise Only**: All solutions support local deployment
- **Cloud Integration**: Not evaluated (Google Cloud Vision API unavailable)
- **Hybrid**: Possible with custom implementation

### Open-source vs Commercial

- **All solutions are open-source** (Apache 2.0 license)
- **Zero licensing costs**
- **Community support available**

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: PaddleOCR

**Rationale:**

- Highest accuracy (90.7%) with acceptable latency (1.08s)
- Excellent multi-language support crucial for Hekate ecosystem
- Active development and maintenance
- Easy integration and deployment
- Good documentation and community

### Integration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy PaddleOCR for production use
2. **Phase 2**: Benchmark against business requirements
3. **Phase 3**: Evaluate custom solution development if needed

## Conclusion

PaddleOCR emerges as the optimal solution for the Hekate ecosystem, providing the best balance of accuracy, speed, and ease of integration.

## Next Steps

I would like to give another suggestion which is manual deployment. Manual deployment helps us to fine-tune our dataset. At the same time, it optimizes costs. Here I have deployed using 2 models, YOLO11 + CRNN. ​​Although the results may not be good, I think replacing CRNN with better models like Transformers will give more feasible results.
